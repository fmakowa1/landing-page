                    <h1>Rabbit meat is awesome.</h1>
                    <p>Why rabbit meat, you ask? Well, as the famous quote goes, "Rabbit meat is like chicken that went to high school!!" This is because rabbit meat is leaner, more flavorful, and more nutritious than chicken. It's a great alternative to traditional meats like beef, pork, and chicken, and it's perfect for anyone looking to expand their culinary horizons.</p>
